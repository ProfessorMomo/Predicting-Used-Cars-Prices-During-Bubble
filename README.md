# Predicting-Used-Cars-Prices-During-Bubble

For this task, our group decided to predict the prices of used cars from Craigslist during the used car price bubble. We used a combination of different features in a linear regression model in order to see which combination would be the most accurate at predicting the price. The packages of Pandas, Sklearn, and Seaborn were used to clean and process the data, create the linear regression model, and visualize our data exploration processes, respectively.
